        <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
        <p>My hubby gave me excellent remarks. Because I come from a different background, this class is new to me. He was overjoyed when he first saw this dragon creation, claiming that I had exceeded his expectations. It was difficult for me to learn new things that I had never heard of before, coming from a completely different background (nursing). I know I need to work hard in this class, but I also have the opportunity to learn a lot in the first semester. Since this is the final project, I can make it more appealing and add additional content based on his suggestions. To accomplish better in the coming semester, I'll need more practice.
This class was both fascinating and challenging for me, but I had a fantastic opportunity to learn a wide range of skills, including HTML, CSS, JS, programming languages, and so on. I learned a lot of new stuff at the end of the semester. I'm not sure how well I performed this semester, but I made every effort to show up for class. After class, I used to watch videos and was never afraid to ask questions. My instructor's feedback also encouraged me to enhance my work, and I believe I did so to some extent.</p>
